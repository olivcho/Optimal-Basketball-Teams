Each player evaluated all 14 other players on 6 key basketball skills. Peer evaluations were averaged to produce a feature vector for each player. See "radar charts" for the skill distributions.

​The 6 components were compressed with PCA and graphed. The axes don't correspond to easily interpretable numbers but show general relationships and trends.
